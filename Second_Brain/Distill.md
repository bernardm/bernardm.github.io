## Progressive Summarization

Progressive summarization is a multi-step process of iteratively refining summaries to condense information. By focusing on different levels of detail in each pass, you can gradually distill the key insights.

1. Initial reading: Begin by reading the entire text or article without making any annotations or highlights. The purpose of this first pass is to gain a general understanding of the content.

2. Highlighting: On the second pass, start highlighting or underlining the most relevant sections or phrases that stand out to you. These could be key ideas, quotes, statistics, or anything that you find noteworthy.

3. Bold highlights: In the third pass, review your initial highlights and make them more specific and concise. Identify the most important parts and bold them or use a different color to distinguish them from the rest of the text.

4. Summarization: At this stage, you will have a document with highlighted and bolded sections. Now, create a summary or an outline of the content by extracting the key points from the highlighted sections. This summary should capture the main ideas and important details in a condensed form.

5. Layered summarization: With each subsequent pass, you can further refine your summary by adding more layers of detail. Use different formatting or colors to indicate different levels of importance or relevance. This approach allows you to progressively deepen your understanding of the material and focus on the most significant aspects.

6. Review and revisit: Regularly reviewing and revisiting your summaries reinforces understanding and consolidates knowledge. By revisiting the layered summaries, you can quickly refresh your memory on key insights without re-reading the entire text.
