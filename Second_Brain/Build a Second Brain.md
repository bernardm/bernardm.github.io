# Build a Second Brain

**Building a Second Brain** is a framework for creating a digital repository of knowledge. It helps you capture, organize, and retrieve information, enhancing learning and creativity.

**Individual notes are the building blocks of your knowledge base.** By connecting them, you create a network that facilitates information retrieval, idea generation, and creative thinking.

## goal

The Building a Second Brain Methodology will teach you how to:

- Reduce stress and "information overload" by curating and managing your personal information stream
- Find anything you've learned, touched, or thought about in the past within seconds
- Spend less time looking for things and more time doing the best, most creative work you are capable of
- Cultivate a collection of valuable knowledge and insights over time without having to follow rigid, time-consuming rules
- Consistently move your projects and goals to completion by organizing and accessing your knowledge in a results-oriented way

## CODE - The second brain process

- **Capture**: Keep what resonates

  - Think like a curator
  - Keep only what resonates
  - Utilize capture tools

- **Organize**: Save for actionability

  - Adopt the PARA Method
  - Ask three questions
    1. What **Project** would this be useful for?
    2. If none, which **Area** will this be useful for?
    3. If none, which **Resource** does this belong to?

- **Distill**: [Find the essence](Distill.md)

  - Design notes for your future self
  - Summarize progressively, at different levels of detail
  - Distill opportunistically, a little bit at a time

- **Express**: Show your work
  - Don't just consume information passively. Put it to use
  - Create smaller, reusable units of work
  - Share your work with the world

Areas
: Roles and responsibilities you're managing over time
